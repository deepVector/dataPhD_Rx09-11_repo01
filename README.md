**_Geolocated sample information for rock specimens collected between 2009 and 2011 in west-central Yukon - Data repository 1_**

* * *

This data repository contains a subset of geolocated geoscientific observations collected between 2009 and 2011 by [Witold Ciolkiewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/witold-c/) in west-central [Yukon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yukon/).  The data describes the location and selected attributes of a set of rock samples currently (December 2019) in storage at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences ([EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca)) of the University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca)).  The dataset was produced following a request for information received from Jim Ryan of the Geological Survey of Canada ([GSC](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/research-centres-labs/geological-survey-canada)).

The observations were collected during field research that was carried out as part of Ph.D. studies conducted by Witold Ciolkiewicz at the UBC Mineral Deposit Research Unit ([MDRU](https://www.mdru.ubc.ca)) under the supervision of [James Mortensen](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/jamesmortensen) (MDRU-UBC) and [Craig Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-hart-a2132419) (MDRU-UBC), with external supervision by Jim Ryan (GSC).

The Ph.D. research was supported by the Geological Survey of Canada ([GSC](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/research-centres-labs/geological-survey-canada)), the Yukon Geological Survey ([YGS](https://yukon.ca/en/science-and-natural-resources/geology)) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ([NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca)), through a grant to the [Yukon Gold Project](http://old.mdru.ubc.ca/home/research/yg/yg.php).
