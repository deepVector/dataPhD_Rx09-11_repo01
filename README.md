**_Geolocated sample information for rock specimens collected between 2009 and 2011 in west-central Yukon - Data repository 1_**

* * *

This data repository contains a subset of geolocated geoscientific observations collected between 2009 and 2011 by [Witold Ciolkiewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/witold-c/) in west-central [Yukon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yukon/).  The data describes the location and selected attributes of a set of rock samples currently (December 2019) in storage at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences ([EOAS](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca)) of the University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca)).  

The dataset was produced following a request for information received from Jim Ryan of the Geological Survey of Canada ([GSC](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/research-centres-labs/geological-survey-canada)).

The observations were collected during field research that was carried out as part of Ph.D. studies conducted by Witold Ciolkiewicz at the UBC Mineral Deposit Research Unit ([MDRU](https://www.mdru.ubc.ca)) under the supervision of [James Mortensen](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/jamesmortensen) (MDRU-UBC) and [Craig Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-hart-a2132419) (MDRU-UBC), with external supervision by Jim Ryan (GSC).

The Ph.D. research was supported by the Geological Survey of Canada ([GSC](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/research-centres-labs/geological-survey-canada)), the Yukon Geological Survey ([YGS](https://yukon.ca/en/science-and-natural-resources/geology)) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ([NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca)), through a grant to the [Yukon Gold Project](http://old.mdru.ubc.ca/home/research/yg/yg.php).

The file:

(1) contains a list of rock sample numbers (_n_=170) from the Ph.D. research of Witold Ciolkiewicz that is of interest to the Geological Survey of Canada, and

\* It is assumed that _Loc_Desc_ refers to a description of the collected rock sample.

## Rock sample information from 2009-2011 field research in west-central Yukon

Rock sample locations and field lithological observations were accessed from proprietary project datasets that were produced with the _Ganfeld_ digital field data collection framework developed by [Shimamura, Williams and Buller (2008)](https://doi.org/10.4095/226214) for the Geological Survey of Canada:

| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STATIONID  | STATION_wc_LIVE  | This is a unique key (e.g. \_10WCI010_) that identifies each station stop based on year (e.g. 2010 = 10), the geologist's ID (e.g. _WCI_ for "Witold Ciolkiewicz" or _RAYWC_, for "Witold Ciolkiewicz as a member of the GSC field team supervised by Jim Ryan"), and an incrementing number up to 999 stations for one field year (modified after [Shimamura, Williams and Buller, 2008](https://doi.org/10.4095/226214)). |
| EARTHMATID | EARTHMAT_wc_LIVE | The \_EARTHMATID_ (e.g. _10WCI010A_) is a unique ID for the rock being described, created by appending a letter of the alphabet to the StationID.  The dominant rock type is usually denoted with the letter _A_, followed by _B_ for a second, less abundant rock type (e.g. a minor intrusion), etc. (modified after [Shimamura, Williams and Buller, 2008](https://doi.org/10.4095/226214)).                             |
| SAMPLEID   | SAMPLE_wc_LIVE   | This is a unique ID for the collected rock sample (e.g. \_10WCI010A01_) created by appending a two-digit numerical code to the EARTHMATID (adapted from [Shimamura, Williams and Buller, 2008](https://doi.org/10.4095/226214)).  The code _01_ usually denotes a reference sample, _02_ a sample intended for lithogeochemical analysis, and _03_ a sample that will be used for a geochronological study.                 |

## Cartographic Reference System

The location data is provided in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) Cartographic Reference System, as implemented by [ArcGIS 10.2](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/).

## Magnetic susceptibility measurements (MAGSUSCEPT)

Field magnetic susceptibility measurements (MAGSUSCEPT) were performed with a high-precision (sensitivity 1\*10<sup>-6</sup> SI units, range 0.000 ― 999\*10<sup>-3</sup> SI units) handheld Magnetic Susceptibility Meter SM-20 ([GF Instruments, 2019](http://www.gfinstruments.cz/index.php?menu=gi&smenu=ims&cont=sm_&ear=ov)). The instrument uses a sensor with diameter of 50 mm that collects 90% of measuring signal from the first 20 mm of the rock.

At each mapping station, the magnetic susceptibility of each investigated lithology was measured multiple times (usually 5 to 10). The measured data were interpreted on the spot, and the value considered most representative of the lithological unit was recorded as the MAGSUSCEPT.
